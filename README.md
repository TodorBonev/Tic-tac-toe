Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe demo project game! This is the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, which has option to play against the computer at two levels: amateur and master level. The game also has multiplayer option.

**Features**
Play against an "amateur" computer: This is the selected mode by default. In this mode, computer chooses its moves randomly, which makes it easy to beat. The human is always the "X Player", and the computer is always the "O Player". With each new game, players take turns to start first.
Play against an "master" computer: In this mode, computer chooses its moves using minimax algorithm. In short - this is a kind of backtracking algorithm, allowing the computer to find the best move. It makes "master" computer practically unbeatable. Here also the human is always the "X Player", and the computer is always the "O Player". With each new game, players are taking turns to start first.
Multiplayer mode: enjoy playing the game with a friend: "X Player" against "O Player". With each new game, players are taking turns to start first.
Keeping score. The score is kept by recording wins for each player, as well as draws. When playing against the computer, it is recorded as human versus computer (amateur or master, depending on the level selected). If multiplayer is selected, it's "X Player" against "O Player". When selecting another computer level or multiplayer, the score will reset.
When someone wins the game, the squares of the winning combination lights up green.
